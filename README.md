## GIPHY Clone

This Giphy Clone was built using React Hooks, the GIPHY API, and SASS. This application includes the following pages: Home, Nav Pages, and a Search Page. Key React features that were used when building this app include Code Splitting, Custom Reusable Components, and a Custom Hook used to retreive data from an API with Axios.

The site has been deployed and is live [here](https://giphy-psi.vercel.app/)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
